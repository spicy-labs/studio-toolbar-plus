# 🛠️ Studio Toolbar Plus

## Because regular toolbars are so last season

Studio Toolbar Plus is a chrome extension that transforms your GraFx Studio Designer Workspace from mild-mannered to superheroic. It's like giving your Studio a radioactive spider bite, but without the weird side effects (mostly).

## ✨ Super Powers Included

- **Layout Image Mapper** - Update image variables through a simple dependencies selection. For the times where Genie cannot make your wishes come true.
- **Enable Actions By Default** - Actions are now enabled in Studio Workspace without you having to do the secret handshake first.
- **Document Download/Upload** - Move Studio documents in and out like they're your favorite Netflix shows.
- **Made with ❤️** - By people who are weirdly passionate about smart templates. Yes, we exist!

## 🚀 Installation (Cape Not Included)

1. Download the latest version zip from [Release](https://github.com/spicy-labs/studio-toolbar-plus/releases/) and unzip the extension

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top-right corner (don't worry, it doesn't actually make you a developer)

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you unzipped the extension

5. Voilà! The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar, ready to save the day

### 🏢 If your IT department blocks extensions

The extension has a **fixed extension ID** that never changes between versions:

```
ohbpbenmjbmoghpliikbiepbdpjiopcg
```

Ask your IT admin to allowlist that ID (Chrome policy `ExtensionInstallAllowlist`).
They only have to do it once — every future release keeps the same ID.

> Versions **before 0.20.0** had an ID that changed on every install, which is why
> an allowlist entry used to stop working after an upgrade. That's fixed as of 0.20.0.

## ⚠️ Current State of Affairs

This is a very early version - like "just learned to walk" early. It should be stable enough for daily use, but the code definitely needs cleanup and testing. Think of it as adopting a puppy that's mostly housebroken.

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Hovering over values in the action editor in Studio to get type hints and error messages doesn't work. It's not you, it's us! If you need this information, you can temporarily disable the extension (right-click the extension icon → Manage Extensions → toggle off).
