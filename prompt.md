Please carefully analyze the tasks.md file to understand all the tasks listed there. For each task:

1. First, thoroughly examine and understand what the task requires by reading the task description and any related code or documentation
2. Use the codebase-retrieval tool to gather detailed information about relevant code components, APIs, and existing implementations that relate to each task
3. Create a detailed implementation plan for each task, considering:
   - Required code changes and their locations
   - Dependencies between tasks (if any)
   - Potential impacts on existing functionality
4. Implement each task systematically using the appropriate tools:
   - Follow the project's existing patterns and conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling using raiseError instead of console.log
   - Maintain consistency with the React/TypeScript/Bun/Mantine UI stack

Please start by examining the tasks.md file to understand what needs to be implemented, then ultrathink and proceed with the implementation in a logical order.
